# 🐳 Running the Application (Recommended Way)

This project requires:

- PostgreSQL  
- Redis  
- Eve_Book Backend & UI  

The easiest way to run everything is using **Docker Compose**.

---

## ✅ Step 1 — Install Requirements

Make sure you have installed:

- Docker  
- Docker Compose  

---

## ✅ Step 2 — Create `docker-compose.yaml`

Create a file named : docker-compose.yaml
Paste this inside:

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:

  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    container_name: event_postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: EventBooking
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:7
    container_name: event_redis
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

  event_app:
    image: harshzazadiya/eve_book:latest
    container_name: event_booking_app
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
      - "8501:8501"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/EventBooking
      REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379
      SECRET_KEY: super-secret-key
      ADMIN_SETUP_KEY: setup_admin_key
      BASE_URL: http://backend:8000

volumes:
  postgres_data:
````

---

## ✅ Step 3 — Run Application

Inside the folder containing `docker-compose.yaml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## ✅ Step 4 — Access the Application
🌐 Backend API

```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

📘 Swagger Docs

```bash
http://localhost:8000/docs
````

🎨 Streamlit UI

```bash
http://localhost:8501
````

---

# 🔐 Creating Admin

There is one by default admin when system starts...
```bash
Username : admin
Password : admin123
```

Then there is endpoint in the Swagger UI where you can add a new admin but you will need a key to make one.

# 💰 Wallet Logic
## 🎟 Booking Flow

User wallet ➜ Deduct ticket price
Host wallet ➜ Receives payment

---

## ❌ Booking Cancellation / Admin Deletion

User wallet ➜ Refunded
Host wallet ➜ Deducted
